# SentimentAnalysis_ModelTesting
This Repository contains the various scripts used for the Sentimental Analysis project of group "I Sentimentalysti" for the course of Software Engineering @ Politecnico di Bari. We started with a 50k reviews dataset from IMDB (found on Kaggle) and created a model which can be used to classify the reviews of a platform to two categories (positive or negative). 
In detail, this is the first of three repositories, and those files contain:
- preprocess algorithms for the dataset (datafile/'IMDB Dataset.csv' --> datafile/preproc_data_def.csv)
- different ML algorithms tested for the Natural Language Processing and classification of reviews (model_testing)
- a comparison between the algorithms's performance (datafile/'tabella risultati.xlsx')
- the exported final model (Logistic Regression with CounVectorizer), the Vectorizer in Pickle format
